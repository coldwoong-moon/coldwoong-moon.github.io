## UI/UX Improvements

  - Default state is "folded"
  - First 3 TOC items displayed clearly
  - 4th item shows with gradient effect to encourage expanding
  - Full TOC shows up to 6 items when expanded
  - Goal: Prevent unnecessary scrolling on mobile devices
  - Implemented using Playwright for UI state verification
